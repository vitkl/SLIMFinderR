Description: This package lets you predict short linear motifs (SLiMs) that mediate
    interactions between proteins alongside their likely recognition domains. 
    This package accompanies this research paper ????. 
    It uses protein interaction data to define sets of proteins likely to contain 
    SLiMs recognised by one protein. It uses permutation-based method to identify 
    protein domains likely to mediate interactions of that protein.
